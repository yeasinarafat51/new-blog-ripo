    <h1>local storage vs session storage deffernce</h1>
    <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab</p>
    <h1>gobal scope and block scope difference</h1>
    <p>The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords</p>
    <h1>avascript event loop how to work</h1>
    <p>he Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
    <h1>how to undefined in javascript</h1>
    <p> The undefined is not a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and thus it is possible to declare a variable with the name undefined. So the correct way to test undefined variable or property is using the typeof operator, like this: if(typeof myVar === 'undefined') .</p>
